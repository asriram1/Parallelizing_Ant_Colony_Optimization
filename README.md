# Parallelizing_Ant_Colony_Optimization
-	The ACO algorithm is an approximating algorithm using artificial 'ants' that locates good solutions by moving through a parameter space representing all possible solutions, and chooses a given path based on probabilistic techniques that involve parameters such as pheromone levels deposited by other ants, and distance. In this case, ACO algorithm is used to determine the shortest possible distance to cover all given cities in the travelling salesman problem. 

- Achieved max speedup factor of roughly 19 times using CUDA, and a max speedup factor of close to 6 times using OpenMP over serial implementation.
